# Git pre-commit hook - Runs linting on staged files before commit
# Prevents committing code that violates style rules
# 
# This hook:
# 1. Lints TypeScript/JavaScript files with ESLint
# 2. Validates Markdown files with markdownlint
# 3. Auto-fixes formatting issues where possible
# 
# Configure staged file patterns in package.json under "lint-staged"
# shellcheck source=/dev/null
